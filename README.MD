This is a collection of my Solutions for some classic programing problems.
This solutions demostrate work of some wellknown algorithms if different areas of programming such as:

-Graph Theory
-Dinamymc Programming
-Bit Manipulation
-Recursion
-Game Theory
-Constructive Algorithms
-Greedy
-Search
-Sorting
-Strings
-Implementation

The solutions are coded either on Python 3 or JavaScript (ES2016)
